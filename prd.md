## Narrative
Imagine a groom preparing for his wedding and needing mint ₦200 notes. Instead of calling around to ask “How much will it cost?” he visits GardenCityBDC. He enters ₦500,000, selects “₦200 notes,” and instantly sees the exact cost. Then he checks the FAQ, which explains why mint notes carry a premium. Satisfied, he taps “Buy via WhatsApp,” and the calculation is pre-filled in the chat.
