# Color Theme Guidelines

## Primary Colors

### Brand Green (from logo)
- Hex: `#00D09B`
- Use for: logo, primary headings, icons, and highlighting positive financial data (profit, price increase). Core brand color.

### Deep Slate (primary background)
- Hex: `#131722`
- Use for: main site background. Dark, slightly blue-tinted charcoal that makes accents stand out; sophisticated and modern.

## Secondary Colors

### Surface Gray (UI elements)
- Hex: `#1E222D`
- Use for: elevated UI elements (cards, modals, sidebars, input fields) to create subtle depth.

### Text White (primary text)
- Hex: `#F0F3F7`
- Use for: body text, paragraphs, and labels; slightly off-white for readability on dark backgrounds.

## Accent & Utility Colors

### Accent Gold (call to action)
- Hex: `#FFC043`
- Use for: primary CTAs (“Trade Now,” “Deposit,” “Sign Up”), important notifications, and high-attention elements.

### Signal Red (negative indicator)
- Hex: `#FF5252`
- Use for: loss, price decrease, or errors; clear contrast to Brand Green.
